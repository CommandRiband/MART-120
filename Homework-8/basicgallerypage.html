        <p><strong>The Waffle</strong></p>
		<p>The Whitmore family is having a leisurely breakfast at their home in a suburb of Fresno, California. The sun is shining through a blue, cloudless sky. There's cool breeze that accentuates the family's relaxing mood.</p>
        <p>As Billy licks his lips, his mother walks by his side, with a canister of maple syrup. She gently leans over to pour it over the square waffle, smiling. To her astonishment, as well as Billy's bewilderment, the tasty looking cake sprouts two hands and two legs.</p>
		<p>Billy's dad reads the Sunday newspaper as usual. He hears a loud noise and looks away from the article he's reading. To his surprise, he sees milk spill from his wife's glass along the dining room table as his son's waffle sprints across to its edge.</p>
		<p>As this cake jumps off the Whitmore family table, Mr. Whitmore witnesses the waffle growing a pair of blue eyes (like his), a nose (like his), and a mouth (not like his).</p>
		<p>The waffle lands on his two feet with a quiet thud and tears across the dining room floor, running through the adjacent kitchen. He escapes through a small pet entryway at the base of the Whitmore's kitchen door.</p>
		<p>Billy, along with his mom and dad, stare in surprise at their pet's flapping gateway. Turning his head to look his wife, Barbara, Walter asks, "Arlo never barked, like he usually does. Where's that dog now?"</p>
